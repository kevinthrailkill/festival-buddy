Recently named “Los Angeles dubstep god” by Rolling Stone, 12th Planet AKA John Dadzie and his influential label SMOG Records are widely credited for bringing the British movement stateside, and continue to be a crucial force in the evolution of electronic music. 12th Planet's DJ sets now include a myriad of styles that reflect the current, diverse landscape of EDM music and continue to display his role as an essential tastemaker in the dance music world.</p><p>12th Planet burst onto the scene in 2006, releasing tracks that helped ignite the North American EDM explosion and collaborating with the likes of Skrillex, Kill The Noise, Datsik and Plastician. In 2012, 12th Planet’s seminal track “Reasons” (Doctor P Remix) was named by SPIN Magazine as one of the ‘30 Greatest Dubstep Songs of All Time’ -- after all, “nothing set the tone for domestic bass culture quite like this Planet's orbit,” said SPIN. 12th Planet has gone on to be recognized as “King of Dubstep” by SPIN and “US dubstep godfather” by UK’s dance music bible Mixmag after headlining tours across the globe and performing at major festivals including Coachella, Electric Daisy Carnival, Ultra Music Festival and more.</p><p>Since 2006, 12th Planet has also led what’s become one of the most thriving underground movements in electronic music, with MTV calling the crew a “pioneering incubator of bass music in America.\" The SMOG crew, with 12th Planet at the helm, continues to produce top quality events in Los Angeles and beyond, always pushing forward as an internationally recognized leader in U.S. bass music. However, John Dadzie's role has extended beyond just bass music to encompass the whole of EDM, including what he recently described to OC Weekly as \"transition music,\" -- a sound that incorporates diverse styles and BPMs. His DJ set is no longer classifiable by genre but best dubbed \"a trip to the 12th Planet and back.\"</p>","TwitterName":"12thplanet","IsRemoved":false,"VideoUrl":"","WebsiteUrl":null,"ItunesAlbums":[],"ListViewImageUrl":"http://rscdn.festapp.com/c6ba3618-b76e-44cf-a5b9-66be22436ba23.jpg","SmallImageUrl":"http://rscdn.festapp.com/c6ba3618-b76e-44cf-a5b9-66be22436ba22.jpg","ProfilePlusImageUrl":null,"BigImageUrl":"http://rscdn.festapp.com/c6ba3618-b76e-44cf-a5b9-66be22436ba24.jpg","IsLineupArtist":true,"IsMultiArtist":false,"IsFeaturedArtist":false,"IsItunesable":true,"SoundCloud":"http://soundcloud.com/12thplanet","SchedulingServiceArtistId":null,"FacebookUrl":"http://www.facebook.com/12thplanet","YouTubeUrl":null,"InstagramUrl":"http://www.instagram.com/12thplanet","SpotifyTrackUri":null,"SpotifyUrl":null},{"ArtistId":1037994,"FeaturedSortOrder":0,"VenueArtistId":0,"ArtistName":"Aazar","ArtistTitle":null,"Likes":0,"ArtistBio":"Born and raised in Paris, Aazar holds a major part in Point Point’s team.

Known for pushing boom bap edits onto discerning dance floors and up the charts, the G-House pioneer is irrepressibly drawn to this creative axis as a prodigy and as a rebel.</p><p>ANGELZ synthesized his experience as a producer and his passion as a music lover. “I’ve always liked the rawness of hip-hop mixed with the repetition of house beats. In my live sets, I’ll take some obscure techno tracks and make edits, maybe add acappellas over it, and make them into new tracks. It helps people digest complex genres when you have something familiar.”The former Def Jam signee, who ghost-produced chart topping beats between homework assignments as a 15-year-old, says “Everyone, the labels, were coming at me, asking me to replicate a track I’d made for someone else. So I started sending them random stuff. I had started listening to Detroit techno and Chicago house, and they were like ‘No one can rap on these beats!’ So they stopped calling.” The demand for conformity reminded him of the time his piano teacher chided him for deviating from the assignment and creating a song instead of studying one.</p><p>Testing limits comes easy to ANGELZ, who as a teen was addicted to P2P networks like The Neptunes IRC, “It was super illegal, I didn’t know that Diplo was also on that channel and so was Tyler the Creator. I became a huge hip-hop head in love with Timbaland and the Neptunes. I learned how to sample by listening to Alchemist. I was the biggest pirate,” says the man who adopted the DJ alias Smasha at age 8 to label the Big beat-laden mix tapes he had started making.</p><p>Reinvigorated by a reclusive 2011 in Australia with a “crummy laptop”, ANGELZ prepared for his turn in the spotlight as Skrillex was blowing up. “I was really into Justice, Boys Noize, Crookers, Para One,” he says. “I realized then that there’s a market to be your own man.” It was a game changer for ANGELZ, who at 20 already had 8 years of producing rap to his credit but no idea how to DJ or do the “house thing”.</p><p>Embracing house wholeheartedly, ANGELZ has gone back to one of his enduring strengths: sampling. The proof is undeniable on his new single “Hey Girl”. To be released by French house-master Tchami, its slow, B-boy hard house groove captures ANGELZ’s new sound. “It’s 100% about the vibe.”</p><p>However divergent ANGELZ’s direction may seem, his sonic compass is clearly on point. Though still in his early 20s, ANGELZ’s baroque beats fuse hip-hop’s raw energy and house’s hypnotic rhythms with a psychic’s ear and a veteran’s finesse. Beats that once left executives scratching their heads soon had fans moving their bodies and superstar peers praising him in their sets. The world may not think it’s ready for ANGELZ; fortunately ANGELZ knows better.</p>","TwitterName":"angelzofficial","IsRemoved":false,"VideoUrl":"","WebsiteUrl":null,"ItunesAlbums":[],"ListViewImageUrl":"http://rscdn.festapp.com/90bb3946-1fac-4376-921c-b1aa07dc5e223.jpg","SmallImageUrl":"http://rscdn.festapp.com/90bb3946-1fac-4376-921c-b1aa07dc5e222.jpg","ProfilePlusImageUrl":null,"BigImageUrl":"http://rscdn.festapp.com/90bb3946-1fac-4376-921c-b1aa07dc5e224.jpg","IsLineupArtist":true,"IsMultiArtist":false,"IsFeaturedArtist":false,"IsItunesable":true,"SoundCloud":"https://soundcloud.com/angelzofficial","SchedulingServiceArtistId":null,"FacebookUrl":"https://www.facebook.com/believeinangelz","YouTubeUrl":null,"InstagramUrl":"https://www.instagram.com/believeinangelz/","SpotifyTrackUri":null,"SpotifyUrl":null},{"ArtistId":1037999,"FeaturedSortOrder":0,"VenueArtistId":0,"ArtistName":"Astrix","ArtistTitle":null,"Likes":0,"ArtistBio":"Astrix has been one of the leading trance producers and DJs in the world for more than a decade, carrying his musical message of psychedelic emotional uplifting trance to every corner of the world, to the biggest urban clubs and far away beaches, huge festivals and underground events.

Their work on singles by Paloma Faith, Lady Gaga, Lana del Rey, Tinie Tempah and others, and production for Example (a cut on the ‘Playing in the Shadows’ album) woke the pair up to the possibilities offered by vocalists. It was the start of the journey that led to the forthcoming album, packed with crossover cuts such as the piano-led ‘Breathe’ featuring Dave Gibson, with its contagious, urgent chorus.&nbsp;Or&nbsp;the soulful explosion of ‘No One Like You’ sung with passion by Niara Scarlett.

He has written about and been interviewed about his obsession with food, and since 2014 his cooking skills have been displayed in professional kitchens around the world including pop-up hamburger events at restaurants in the Netherlands. He has collaborated on an artisan beer and a gourmet hot dog, and has a cocktail published in Robert Simonson’s (New York Times cocktail writer) new book “The Old-Fashioned.”</p><p>Dieselboy was the first drum and bass artist to chart a single on Billboard’s dance chart with “Invid” in 2000, and was the first American voted into the UK-based Drum &amp; Bass Arena Top 10 DJs online poll in 2004. He's been featured on magazine covers, interviewed for documentaries, TV and radio, heard on MTV, ESPN and action/adventure video games, and sponsored by DC Shoes and Pioneer Pro DJ.</p><p>In 2002 Dieselboy founded Human Imprint, North America’s most prolific, dynamic and innovative drum and bass label, and is co-founder of SubHuman (dubstep, electro, trap), under the umbrella of Planet Human. Planet Human is beloved by its fans for the quality of its next level high energy releases by international vanguard artists including Bare (US), Mark Instinct (Canada), Mayhem (US), Muffler (Finland), Nerd Rage (US), Nightwalker (UK), NumberNin6 (US), Pixel Fist (UK), Subshock (Spain), Zardonic (Venezuela), and Faces of Def (Dieselboy's collaboration with Mark the Beast).</p><p>Dieselboy’s legacy is also one of non-stop trailblazing dancefloor destruction on the international club circuit as well as at major global music festivals including Bassrush, Bonnaroo, Coachella, Detroit Electronic Music Festival, Electric Daisy Carnival (Las Vegas, Mexico, New York, Puerto Rico), SXSW, Summerfest, Ultra Music Festival, US Virgin Mobile FreeFest, Weird Bass Music Festival, Motion Notion (Canada), Shambhala (Canada), Borsodi Hegyalja Fesztival (Hungary), World Bass Summit (Japan), Jisan Valley Rock Festival (Korea), PRSPCT XL (Netherlands), Creamfields (Poland), Pirate Station (Russia), Global Gathering (UK), and PHAT 09 (New Zealand). He also toured with Moby’s Area2 and played heavy metal concerts with Orgy and Disturbed.</p><p>Dieselboy’s DJ career began in northwest Pennsylvania DJing high school dances. While a student at the University of Pittsburgh he learned to beat-match vinyl live on college radio and played trance, happy hardcore and breaks at house parties. His 1994 mixtape “The Future Sound of Hardcore” led to out of town bookings and his expanding popularity and technical skills led to the honor of being the first American asked by a British drum and bass label to mix a compilation (“Drum &amp; Bass Selection USA,” 1996).</p><p>In 1997 Dieselboy moved to Philadelphia to be drum and bass buyer and T-shirt designer for seminal rave culture/record store 611. In 1998 Dieselboy was the first American drum and bass DJ to be nominated for Best Drum &amp; Bass DJ at the Global DJ Mix Awards and tied with LTJ Bukem. From 1998 to 2004 Dieselboy hosted North America’s premier drum and bass weekly “Platinum” at club Fluid.</p><p>In 2000, Dieselboy co-founded with fellow Stateside drum and bass warriors AK1200 and DJ Dara the Planet of the Drums super crew (with MC Messinian) - electronic dance music's longest running annual tour, now in its 16th year (2015).</p><p>Dieselboy continuously raises the bar for the DJ mix as an art form, and each of his from 1992 to his latest tour de force “Dieselboy - The Destroyer” stands the test of time. State of the art showcases of producers and graphic artists of each respective musical era, Dieselboy’s mixes have been described as “cinematic” and “intoxicating.”</p><p>Dieselboy’s goal in creating each mix is “to make the most intricate, layered, nuanced, amazing drum and bass mix ever done. Period.” His sixth sense for sublime exquisite blends - \"the sound of heaven crashing into hell,\" as he once described it - is as transcendent as it is legendary.</p><p>In his dramatic intros (a Dieselboy trademark) his narrators [who include movie trailer voice legend Don LaFontaine, Peter Cullen (“The Transformers”' Optimus Prime), Lynanne Zager (“Lost,” “Fantastic Four”), and Corey Burton (Disney)] describe epic - from sci-fi fantasy to soul-crushing post apocalyptic to grindhouse - scenarios. (His intro to \"Wake the Dead\" is a thinly veiled reference to the death of the art of DJing – a theme that resonates amongst fellow technically skilled DJs, fans and dance music aficionados.)</p><p>An inspiration for generations of DJs, Dieselboy’s longevity and relevance in a mercurial industry is a tribute to his relentless drive to create “amazing” experiences for his fans in their iPods and at his infamously explosive live shows.</p><p>Dieselboy fans praise his skills as “genius.” Says The Destroyer: “I don’t fuck around.”</p>","TwitterName":"djdieselboy","IsRemoved":false,"VideoUrl":"","WebsiteUrl":null,"ItunesAlbums":[],"ListViewImageUrl":"http://rscdn.festapp.com/e2a55712-8fb7-4dd4-ae3a-a20ac13c2f2b3.jpg","SmallImageUrl":"http://rscdn.festapp.com/e2a55712-8fb7-4dd4-ae3a-a20ac13c2f2b2.jpg","ProfilePlusImageUrl":null,"BigImageUrl":"http://rscdn.festapp.com/e2a55712-8fb7-4dd4-ae3a-a20ac13c2f2b4.jpg","IsLineupArtist":true,"IsMultiArtist":false,"IsFeaturedArtist":false,"IsItunesable":true,"SoundCloud":"https://soundcloud.com/dieselboy","SchedulingServiceArtistId":null,"FacebookUrl":"https://www.facebook.com/Dieselboy","YouTubeUrl":null,"InstagramUrl":"http://www.instagram.com/thedieselboy/","SpotifyTrackUri":null,"SpotifyUrl":null},{"ArtistId":1038019,"FeaturedSortOrder":0,"VenueArtistId":0,"ArtistName":"Dombresky","ArtistTitle":null,"Likes":0,"ArtistBio":"<p style=\"\">Dombresky, producer from Paris, made his name with his unique style and his finesse, which allowed him to make an official remix for A-Trak’s “We All Fall Down” and a collaboration with Tchami on the track « Freakin » released on his EP.</p><p>Dombresky keeps impressing the house scene with his track « Hardcore » fresh off his Ep « Reaching Perfection » released on the prestigious « Fool’s Gold » label in which he’s delivering us elaborated tracks and a very aesthetic music.</p><p>With his brand new single « Wait » Dombresky made the pressure rise once again and provides us a track of a cheerful melody, signed on Tchami’s label “Confession”.</p><p>Supported by artists like Diplo, DJ Snake, Anna Lunoe &amp; many others, he highlighted a house way old school and stands out as one of the new faces of the French Electro scene.</p>","TwitterName":"Dombresky","IsRemoved":false,"VideoUrl":"","WebsiteUrl":null,"ItunesAlbums":[],"ListViewImageUrl":"http://rscdn.festapp.com/3dc8d0de-7390-4f4a-91be-21083e3727f93.jpg","SmallImageUrl":"http://rscdn.festapp.com/3dc8d0de-7390-4f4a-91be-21083e3727f92.jpg","ProfilePlusImageUrl":null,"BigImageUrl":"http://rscdn.festapp.com/3dc8d0de-7390-4f4a-91be-21083e3727f94.jpg","IsLineupArtist":true,"IsMultiArtist":false,"IsFeaturedArtist":false,"IsItunesable":true,"SoundCloud":"https://soundcloud.com/dombresky","SchedulingServiceArtistId":null,"FacebookUrl":"https://www.facebook.com/Dombresky/","YouTubeUrl":null,"InstagramUrl":"https://www.instagram.com/dombresky/","SpotifyTrackUri":null,"SpotifyUrl":null},{"ArtistId":1038021,"FeaturedSortOrder":0,"VenueArtistId":0,"ArtistName":"Ekali","ArtistTitle":null,"Likes":0,"ArtistBio":"<p style=\"\">Ekali is a Canadian instrumentalist and producer from Vancouver, BC.

Loadstar is a perfect modern example of that wisdom.</p><p>Made up of Gavin Harris and Nick Hill, formerly and respectively known to the world of drum &amp; bass as Xample and Lomax, this duo has surpassed the highest expectations in recent years by fusing their individual styles and creating a pioneering sound that imbues club dance floors, iPods and huge festival arenas with incredible energy and impeccable musical precision.</p><p>Loadstar’s individual parts met while Bristol-born Gavin was studying sociology at Liverpool University and self-admittedly spending more time concentrating on writing and promoting music than attending lectures and writing essays. It was while promoting a local D&amp;B night with a friend that Gavin booked Holdtight, a production outfit that Nick was one-third of at the time. Not long after that initial meeting, Gavin returned home to Bristol from University and bumped into Nick, who had also just moved to town. The rest, as they say, was history.</p><p>Or, to be more precise, it was the fusing of two histories. Nick’s involvement in Holdtight was already overshadowed by his consistently brilliant solo releases under his Lomax name. With a propensity for musical and melodic drum &amp; bass, Lomax’s productions graced many of the scene’s most respected labels, but it was his Ram Records debut ‘Artisan VIP,’ single-handedly turned into an anthem by Andy C, which really pushed him to the next level.</p><p>Xample’s solo works were also noticed by Andy C and Scott Bourne, owners of Ram Records when he sent them a few demos over instant messenger. Within 10 minutes they got back to Gavin and eventually he signed as an exclusive artist to the label, releasing a string of heavy dance floor killers.</p><p>By 2009 Xample &amp; Lomax were sharing studio space and starting to release more and more material together. Combining Nick’s traditional training, courtesy of Goldsmiths University, London, and Gavin’s self-taught production genius, it was clear they had something special to offer the world of dance music. Tracks like 2006’s ‘The Latter’ and 2009’s ‘Contra’ were sowing the seeds of a brand new project.</p><p>Every new project needs a new name, and Xample &amp; Lomax made the brave decision to jump headfirst into their new venture with a completely fresh face. Whilst searching for ideas to fuel their imagination and tie in their new name with their upcoming Ram release ‘Link 2 The Past’, the boys sifted through old rave tape packs and computer game cassettes. Then they came across their old Emu sampler, a relatively antiquated piece of machinery that took ages to load each sample. While loading them, the sampler displayed a spinning star, and it’s this which became the inspiration for Loadstar’s moniker.</p><p>An instant success, the duo’s incredible new musical direction coupled with the backing of Ram Records ensured that Loadstar’s path to the highest echelons of the scene was assured. And while both Gavin and Nick agree that for the moment they’re rooted in credible, underground D&amp;B, they’re the first to admit that they’re excited about the current state of bass music and its propensity to absorb new genres, styles and tempos at a moment’s notice.</p><p>Fans of drum &amp; bass and even bass music in general can be assured that Loadstar have everything it takes to be one of the most exciting acts in dance music today. Years of experience in crafting the highest quality music that’s as happy on your home stereo as it is in huge arenas, a worryingly busy DJ diary that sees them touring the globe with fellow Bristolian MC Texas and support from admiring nightclub-goers, club DJs and the media alike means that Loadstar are undoubtedly spearheading the bass music revolution.</p>","TwitterName":"Loadstar","IsRemoved":false,"VideoUrl":"","WebsiteUrl":null,"ItunesAlbums":[],"ListViewImageUrl":"http://rscdn.festapp.com/4861f7f1-a59f-4610-801b-dcb505ae44ea3.jpg","SmallImageUrl":"http://rscdn.festapp.com/4861f7f1-a59f-4610-801b-dcb505ae44ea2.jpg","ProfilePlusImageUrl":null,"BigImageUrl":"http://rscdn.festapp.com/4861f7f1-a59f-4610-801b-dcb505ae44ea4.jpg","IsLineupArtist":true,"IsMultiArtist":false,"IsFeaturedArtist":false,"IsItunesable":true,"SoundCloud":"http://soundcloud.com/loadstar","SchedulingServiceArtistId":null,"FacebookUrl":"http://www.facebook.com/Loadstarmusic","YouTubeUrl":null,"InstagramUrl":"https://www.instagram.com/loadstar/","SpotifyTrackUri":null,"SpotifyUrl":null},{"ArtistId":1038038,"FeaturedSortOrder":0,"VenueArtistId":0,"ArtistName":"MC Dino","ArtistTitle":null,"Likes":0,"ArtistBio":"<p style=\"\">Colorado junglists know him as MC Dino, the infamous 8-year resident of Breakdown Thursdays at the Snake Pit, the nation's #1 Drum and Bass club night. The rock star emcee most notorious for his poetic genius with a microphone has commanded crowds at such well known and respected events as Cyberfest, Bassrush, Electric Daisy Carnival and countless other raves and festivals across the&nbsp;United States. Recognized for his high-energy lyrical prowess on the microphone, MC Dino is a crowd favorite on the mic and is an asset to any DJ he rhymes alongside.</p><p>Although Dino is not his given name, it is his preference and insists that the other is irrelevant. Though born in a small farming community in Northern Colorado, Dino spent time growing up in Mexico and various parts of California before returning to Colorado well over a decade ago. In high school he spent more time writing lyrics, songs, and practicing with bands in backyards than on his schoolwork. He began going to raves when he was 14, a time when raves were new and entirely underground. This exposure had great influence on him; electronic music provided a new medium and mode of tampering with instrumental sound. In this scene he also discovered jungle music and emceeing. Besides the obvious electronic movement that so dramatically shaped his personal musical efforts, Dino's other prominent influences include Prince, Roni Size and Santana. Exposure to these along with an upbringing encouraging all music is especially evident in his individual work, emceeing, and collaborations with Urban Aboriginee.</p><p>In 1997 he set out as an emcee and, inspired by the aggressive new sound jungle provided, used it as an outlet for the poetry streaming through his head. By this time he had already taught himself to dj and moved between rhyming and spinning, while continuing to write his own music. 1998 proved a year of reckoning and direction. He started performing regularly at the Snake Pit on a night then called Plastic Thursdays that offered techno one half of the night and jungle the other. During this period Dino gathered his musically-inclined cohorts and formed a solid group called Urban Aboriginee. The idea behind Urban Aboriginee was to promote the various but sometimes neglected talents (emceeing, DJing, producing, etc) of his intimate circle. The name alludes to modern day tribesmen surviving the streets of a concrete jungle (the city). Urban Aboriginee was recognized throughout Denver for its dedication to Jungle music. For five years, UA sponsored Kombat Battle, a party that allows young deejays and MC's to showcase their talent and provided an opportunity for up-and-comers to perform live in an actual party atmosphere.&nbsp;</p><p>In 2004 Dino was introduced to Divine Elements through the drum n bass scene when he moved to Los Angeles. Fast forward 6 years of non stop MCing for some of the biggest names in the business and the biggest festivals and night clubs across the United States and we find Dino falling into the front man position with D.E. He ended up filling the void Divine Elements had long been waiting to fulfill with a front man MC. Dino was a fluid fit in the dynamic super group. He now is a&nbsp;consistent, positive force in an already solid musical group, touring and writing music with them all the time .&nbsp;</p><p>During the for mentioned 6 year fast forward between 2004 and 2010, MC Dino has emceed for the greatest names in Drum and Bass, and Dubstep including Andy C, Shimon, Pendulum, Nero, Skrillex, Diesel Boy, AK1200, Dara, Bad Company, Mampi Swift, Teach Itch, and Craze, to name a few.

His large volume of work for the label, features on the Night Bass Mixmag Lab takeover &amp; Sinden’s appearance at the Night Bass club night in Los Angeles in February 2016 have firmly cemented him as permanent fixture in the burgeoning Night Bass camp.&nbsp;</p><p>On the remix front he has also been busy reworking the likes of David Zowie, Bobby Brackins, Alison Wonderland and Dirtybird’s Cause &amp; Affect. Last year Sinden delivered a performance video for Serato which confirmed Sinden's status as a Serato artist.&nbsp;</p><p>Sinden appeared at EDC Las Vegas last Summer on the Night Bass stage. He has also recently been appointed US A&amp;R Manager for Australian label Sweat It Out &amp; hosts their weekly radio show syndicating across the following networks; Raw FM (Australia), Kiss FM (Australia), George FM (New Zealand), BIG FM (Germany), Block FM (Japan) and online station Dash Radio. A compilation entitled Sinden Presents Sweat It Out USA is due out this Spring and highlights his good ear and knack for A&amp;R. Curated and hand picked by Sinden, its a an exciting snapshot of both established &amp; up and coming artists in the House Music world.&nbsp;</p><p>Sinden’s music has worldwide support from DJ’s such as Shiftk3y, AC Slater, Tommy Trash, Oliver Heldens, A-Trak, Destructo, Anna Lunoe, Shadow Child, Boys Noize, Tchami, Motez and more.</p><p>Growing up in Hockley, rural Essex, the first music that really struck a chord with a teenaged Sinden was rap music, “a potent controversial force, more rebellious than political than anything around at the time,” with Beastie Boys, NWA, 2 Live Crew, and Dr Dre proving to be the soundtrack of his formative years. Trips to record shops in nearby Southend soon fostered an interest in Jungle, which by his own admission took over his life; a huge influence owing to its intrinsic Britishness, attitude and time stretched beats.</p><p>He quickly amassed a vast record collection which was showcased at university parties, playing an eclectic mix of old funk and disco 45's, Latin and Afrobeat, rap, jungle, dancehall, 2step garage, house and techno. “I was inspired by Gilles Peterson's 'joining the dots' attitude to DJing,” he remembers, “where you could move a dancefloor on your own terms, entertain and educate.”</p><p>Trips to London soon followed, where, hungry for more, Sinden headed straight for Bar Rhumba’s That’s How It Is night and Metalheadz at the Blue Note and later, East London’s seminal basement club Plastic People. These nights would prove to have a lasting effect on the young DJ, opening his already eclectic tastes up to an exhilarating world of new music.</p><p>Making the move to the capital when he was 21, a chance meeting with Dave Taylor – recording as Solid Groove at the time before he took on his better-known Switch sobriquet – would prove more than fruitful. The pair met through Made To Play boss Jesse Rose during a late night flyering session outside Rhumba and hit it off immediately. A collaboration was soon in the works, despite Sinden decidedly lacking in studio time compared to the more experienced Taylor. It was a risk that would soon pay off, however, with the young upstart’s extensive vinyl collection coming in very handy indeed, delivering a wealth of samples and loops they’d soon incorporate into choice cuts like ‘Overbooked’ and ‘Red Hot’.&nbsp;</p><p>It was also around this time that Sinden would meet another soon-to-be long term collaborator, Joshua Harvey aka Herve. The pair would go on to release their debut album as The Count and Sinden on Domino Records, featuring a wealth of special guests including the Mystery Jets and a young Katy B. “There was a big collaborative ethos within the group – Jesse Rose, Switch, Herve, Trevor Loveys and myself would frequently as a unit all make music with each other,” Sinden recalls. “That’s when we started that whole wave of new house music with basslines, inspired by the jacking house of Chicago and NY but mixed up with a UK sensibility – basslines from jungle and odd leftfield approaches. It was reactionary to all the really boring house that was around.” They coined the term Fidget for this style of house music &amp; its influence is still very prominent in the house bass music that is gaining increasing momentum in 2015.&nbsp;</p><p>A weekly Kiss FM radio show was soon in the works, providing a platform for the fresh, innovative tunes that Sinden relishes discovering. And then in 2010 he took the leap that many producers hope to do and founded his own label, Grizzly. He said at the time, “I want Grizzly to reflect my style of club music which is all-embracing, fun, disparate and twisted up... ‘grey area’ sounds, music you can’t quite put your finger on, stuff that sits between genres and puzzles you at the same time. Grizzly will bring this sense of unexpectedness, flitting between styles – it’s serious music without taking itself too seriously.”</p><p>While this undoubtedly still rings true, two years later a full-to-bursting release schedule, a recent European tour and the same uncompromising attitude have seen the label evolve into a veritable hotbed of new talent, launching the likes of Melé, Brenmar and Matrixxman and seeing early releases from XL’s masked man SBTRKT and an incognito Felix Buxton of Basement Jaxx as disco lothario Jon Giovanni.&nbsp;</p><p>Sinden himself has helmed four releases on Grizzly – two collaborations with SBTRKT in ‘Midnight Marauder’ and ‘Seekwal’, ‘Pull Up Wheel Up’ and ‘Keep It 1000’. This is a label boss who likes to get involved. The year 2011 saw him chosen as the official producer of the second Gucci Mane mixtape, ‘Free Gucci 2’, featuring a who’s who of British producers including Hudson Mohawke, Toddla T, Duke Dumont, Mosca and Rustie each offering their own unique take on the biggest Gucci jams.</p><p>Always keen to set new challenges for himself, itchy feet and the need for a change of scene prompted a move to Los Angeles 4 years ago, which was and continues to be a hugely positive experience for Sinden. “The music scene in LA is at a really interesting crossing point, there are some great parties and some really open minded folk. Dance music is exciting here, plus there is loads of scope for working with new rappers and singers.”&nbsp;</p><p>Other accomplishments have seen Sinden drafted in to executive produce rapper Mykki Blanco’s Betty Rubble EP, release EP’s on A-Trak’s Fools Gold label, Mad Decent, Red Bull, Sweat It Out, Night Bass &amp; Boys Noize Records with 2 contributions to their annual Miami Noize Compilation, as well as collaborative releases with Shadow Child, Salva, Astronomar, Brenmar &amp; Azari &amp; III Vocalists SYF and Fritz Helder, Nadastrom &amp; Salva (who he shared the bill with on their month long tour).&nbsp;</p>","TwitterName":"gSINDEN","IsRemoved":false,"VideoUrl":"","WebsiteUrl":null,"ItunesAlbums":[],"ListViewImageUrl":"http://rscdn.festapp.com/319f03be-4298-4c81-8ea2-7142627801843.jpg","SmallImageUrl":"http://rscdn.festapp.com/319f03be-4298-4c81-8ea2-7142627801842.jpg","ProfilePlusImageUrl":null,"BigImageUrl":"http://rscdn.festapp.com/319f03be-4298-4c81-8ea2-7142627801844.jpg","IsLineupArtist":true,"IsMultiArtist":false,"IsFeaturedArtist":false,"IsItunesable":true,"SoundCloud":"https://soundcloud.com/sinden","SchedulingServiceArtistId":null,"FacebookUrl":"https://www.facebook.com/gsinden","YouTubeUrl":null,"InstagramUrl":"https://www.instagram.com/gsinden/","SpotifyTrackUri":null,"SpotifyUrl":null},{"ArtistId":1038060,"FeaturedSortOrder":0,"VenueArtistId":0,"ArtistName":"Snails","ArtistTitle":null,"Likes":0,"ArtistBio":"Snails is a Montreal-based producer and DJ who pushes a forward-thinking brand of dance music combining trap rhythms, dirty bass lines and off-kilter sound design.

In just a few short years the graduate of the revered Icon Collective and self professed gear junkie has proven himself to be a technical mastermind and modern house music connoisseur. The strength of his thick low-end grooves and quirky sound design have caught the ears of A-Track, AC Slater, Destructo, Chris Lake, Malaa and Tchami. His sound has also begun to inject itself onto the ears of mainstream audiences with plays popping up from BBC Radio 1, Rinse FM and Sirius. And with appearances on Night Bass, Confession, This Ain’t Bristol, Main Course, Audiophile and Perfect Driver it’s clear his intent to “Shake up people’s perception of what house is” is well within reach.</p><p>While it may seem like this young bass technician has seen a quick rise, his roots run deep. The former audio engineer and gear junkie found his footing in music at an early age as a vocalist and guitar player. His father hoped to impress upon him a strong emphasis in dance music exposing the budding musician to the likes of Carl Cox and Sasha on road trips from the age of 8. He eventually brought Dillon to EDC at the age of 16. It was this that provided the ultimate inspiration to pursue a career in dance music. His ability to construct a mood extends well beyond the studio into his dynamic and energetic DJ sets. He’s flexed the subs throughout the country bringing his unique sound to Avalon Hollywood, Exchange LA, Webster Hall (NYC) and Insomniac Event’s Escape Psycho Circus. There is no doubt that Dillon will continue to turn heads as he pushes forward in his effort to reshape the face of modern dance

It’s something that she’s carried with her over a diverse career spanning multiple projects, all of which have crystallised in a record that’s a twisted looking glass into the soul of one of Australia’s most promising musician/producers.</p><p>Welcome to the contradictory world of Alison Wonderland; an Australian artist who has written an album during her time in Los Angeles, a public personality who privately obsesses over her music with near-­?maniacal intensity; an electronic producer who is equally proud of her pop songs and her festival bangers.</p><p>She’s a chemical performer who has played cello in orchestras, rocked the bass in indie bands and graced turntables in front of thousands. From Stereosonic to Splendour and Coachella, not to mention a killer ‘Diplo and Friends’&nbsp;BBC&nbsp;radio mix and a national run of secret warehouse shows that sold out in hours, Alison Wonderland has probably racked up more air miles in the last 18 months than hours of sleep.</p><p>Thanks to the non-­?stop rotation of her breakout hit ‘I Want U’, which topped Hypemachine and its EP Calm Down, which garnered millions of plays on Soundcloud, Wonderland has become known not only as a crowd-­?pleaser, but also for her ability to craft great songs. ‘The way to be a good producer is about using your ears,’ says Wonderland. ‘If you just did what textbooks said, nothing new would ever happen.’</p><p>To help her develop this vision on her first feature-­?length, Wonderland worked with some great songwriters from both sides of the equator; Djemba Djemba, known for his work with Diplo’s&nbsp;MAD DECENT&nbsp;label and the cutting edge up and coming producers from around the world&nbsp;AWE, Lido, Ganz and Alexander Burnett.</p><p>Run is a record that feels like the ones Wonderland bought growing up. As a DJ, if you don’t have a direction to take an audience in, what’s the point of playing a set? I feel the same about an album, she says. With its definitive opener and closer, Run is defined by its shapeliness. “Order is so important”, says Wonderand. “Even live, it’s not always about being ‘bang bang bang’; you have to have lulls, you have to bring people up again, you have to take them to another place and do it tastefully.”</p><p>Running the gamut from electronica, future beats, trap, and dancehall to classical and pop music, Run, is a dance album with personality. Wonderland sings on almost every track, a decision she made while in Los Angeles, and also took lyrical control. “My lyrics and melodies come faster the more music I’ve written, and it’s easier to delve into my mind,” she says. “Especially these days, music that’s made from your soul is better than music that’s made from your brain.”</p><p>The record boasts a robust rolodex of guest collaborators, all of whom Wonderland describes as close family. “I’ve never dialled in someone. I only wanted to make this album with people I fucking love,” she said of Run, which features Norwegian wunderkind Lido, New York rapper Johnny Nelson,&nbsp;SAFIA’s Ben Woolner-­?KIrkham and even Flaming Lips impresario, Wayne Coyne. Wonderland’s approach to writing with others, like most of her life, is refreshingly unorthodox. “The first thing I say [when someone I’ve never met gets to the studio] is ‘Tell me what’s going on with your life. I want to hear the last thing that made you cry.’ And we sit for hours and talk to each other and then we get down to the music.”</p><p>Run is about striving for greatness, and never feeling like you’re quite there, which is sort of what Wonderland means she says it’s an album about her time in Los Angeles, and observations of people, love, anxiety and the industry. It’s the infectious groove of first single ‘U Don’t Know’, the crushing beats of ‘Ignore’ and the near-­?ecstatic release ‘Carry On’, the sound of the DJ who won’t leave the stage until the makeup is running down her face and she’s drenched in sweat. It’s the anthems-­?in-­?waiting, ‘Run’, ‘I Want U’ and ‘Games’, a pop number sneaking out of left field.</p><p>But what Run is really all about, what you can hear and feel when you play it, is Wonderland’s very real inability to sit still. ‘I always feel like I’m never satisfied,’ she says. ‘When I get to a certain place, I’m still not content. It’s really about pushing yourself.’</p><p>Alison Wonderland dives down all manner of audio rabbit holes with Run and emerges with something unique and personal. She drives everyone around her crazy. She drives herself crazy…But her debut album is out, she’s played Coachella had two&nbsp;ARIA&nbsp;nominations and here she is, still running.</p><p>The question is, can you keep up?</p>","TwitterName":"awonderdj","IsRemoved":false,"VideoUrl":"","WebsiteUrl":"http://www.alisonwonderland.com.au/","ItunesAlbums":[],"ListViewImageUrl":"http://rscdn.festapp.com/b675efec-06f9-4106-905f-cbf6aa1e13333.jpg","SmallImageUrl":"http://rscdn.festapp.com/b675efec-06f9-4106-905f-cbf6aa1e13332.jpg","ProfilePlusImageUrl":null,"BigImageUrl":"http://rscdn.festapp.com/b675efec-06f9-4106-905f-cbf6aa1e13334.jpg","IsLineupArtist":true,"IsMultiArtist":false,"IsFeaturedArtist":false,"IsItunesable":true,"SoundCloud":"https://soundcloud.com/alisonwonderland","SchedulingServiceArtistId":null,"FacebookUrl":"https://www.facebook.com/awonderdj","YouTubeUrl":null,"InstagramUrl":"http://www.instagram.com/alisonwonderland/","SpotifyTrackUri":null,"SpotifyUrl":null},{"ArtistId":1037997,"FeaturedSortOrder":0,"VenueArtistId":0,"ArtistName":"Aly & Fila","ArtistTitle":null,"Likes":0,"ArtistBio":"<p style=\"\">As hot&nbsp;as the Sahara&nbsp;and standing every bit as tall as pyramids, they’re the single most successful group to have emerged from the spiritual lands of Egypt. From the Med to the Red and from up high in Cairo, to down deep in the Sinai, they’ve built an immense, ultra-loyal in-country following, From that foothold turntable Shamans,&nbsp;Aly Amr Fathalah&nbsp;and Fadi Wassef Naguib&nbsp;went global. With their career-launching Egyptrance releases (inc. ‘Eye of Horus’ and ‘Spirit of Ka’) through to latter-day master-blasters like ‘We Control The Sunlight’, their production credentials are only now matched by their spinning ones. Ranked as one of the 20 biggest DJ acts in EDM (source: DJ Magazine Top 100 DJs 2013), they delight crowds now numbered annually in the millions, bringing their inimitable sound to the world’s most prestigious clubs and festivals. No mirage, no illusion - this is Aly &amp; Fila.</p><p>For close to a decade their spirited take on the trance sound has captured the hearts, minds and imaginations of planet trance. With their whip-smart productions and sandstorm sonics, their performances have raised the bar at some of the world’s most recognized clubs. Comparably they’ve also ruled at EDM’s biggest festivals – EDC - Las Vegas, Tomorrowland, Global Gathering, Dance Valley, Stereosonic, WMC and Full On Ferry to name just a few. Continuing in a long tradition of playing the world’s most established and respected stages, in Spring 2014 they will&nbsp;rock ASOT 650. Marking the 8th successive year they’d done so, the Egyptian duo are the only spinners aside from Armin Van Buuren and Markus Schulz to have played such a run. This combined force of production and turntable feats has resulted in string of high charting positions in several of EDMs’ key polls.

Throughout 2012 they continued to bring some of the year’s best music to club &amp; festival sound-systems. Among them were collaborations with Roger Shah (on ‘Perfect Love’) and Solarstone with ‘Fireisland’. It also saw them re-team with ‘We Control’ singer Jawden on ‘Coming Home’, for a track that DJ Mag cited as “making hairs stand up, goosebumps pop, hands shoot up and jaws meet floors!” They also reworked Gareth Emery’s ‘Concrete Angel’ (which subsequently became the best-selling trance track of 2012), as well as other smash tracks from Andy Moor and Alex M.O.R.P.H.</p><p>2013 saw the duo release the follow up to their Rising Sun Album by releasing their second artist album ‘ Quiet Storm’ with monster hits including ‘Mysteries Unfold’ and ‘Running Out of Time’ .</p><p>2014 promises to see another waves of music from Aly &amp; Fila.

The small seaport town of Mystic, Connecticut, has been the home of Audien (AKA Nate Rathbun) for his entire life, and it’s in a small apartment in Mystic where Audien began creating music in 2008. Using a very basic set up, and a secret cocktail of plug-ins, Audien worked diligently to hone his craft. By age 17, while his friends were either preparing college applications or teeing up jobs, Audien began to test the waters by sending his unsolicited music out to producers, labels &amp; bloggers. Though confident in his sound, Audien carefully managed his expectations, suspecting it was unlikely that he’d hear back from a random demo submission. An enthusiastic response came, however, from Flashover Recordings, the trance label owned by beloved Dutch Producer/DJ Ferry Corsten. Audien’s single “Rise &amp; Shine” was released, and soon thereafter he was off to the races.</p><p>Over the next two years a slew of renowned labels came calling, gravitating to Audien’s stunning melodies &amp; innovative sonic landscapes. Audien worked meticulously, but prolifically, churning out anthems &amp; remixes for labels including Armada, Spinnin, and Anjunabeats, with tracks routinely charting on Beatport. Audien’s tracks also began to appear on compilations assembled by some of the genre’s giants, including Tiesto’s Club Life, Above &amp; Beyond’s Trance Around The World, and Armin Van Buuren’s A State of Trance. A particularly exciting opportunity presented itself in May of 2011, when Audien had the opportunity to open for Van Buuren at New York’s Roseland. In just 3 years, Audien had gone from idolizing Van Buuren to sharing a stage with him.</p><p>As Audien has continued to release tracks into 2012, his music has evolved to include elements of Progressive House. The monster 2012 release These Are The Days was lauded by influential blog Dancing Astronaut as a “catchy summer anthem,” while The Top Sound noted “the combination of flawless evolution, beautiful piano chords, &amp; trance-y plucks makes this an absolutely brilliant track.” Never straying far from his roots, Audien released his highly acclaimed song Eventide on Anjunabeats in August of 2012. Audien’s relationship with Above &amp; Beyond continued to blossom through the fall; in November, A&amp;B premiered Audien’s track Wayfarer as the first ever song played on their new radio show, Above &amp; Beyond Group Therapy.</p><p>Elsewhere in November 2012, Audien released the incendiary progressive house track SUP, via Trice Recordings. SUP was featured by Dutch icon Hardwell on episode 87 of Hardwell On Air. Commenting on the track, Elektro magazine declared, “… this production takes its listeners on a roller coaster ride of uplifting synth progressions, chaotic builds, and hard, bouncing drops that holds the ability to move crowds wherever this banger is played.” Shortly after the track’s release, Audien joined Hardwell on tour for dates in New York &amp; Boston.</p><p>With his ability to create fresh tracks in auto-pilot, Audien has turned his attention to performing live, a craft he takes just as seriously as his production. Audien recently performed at some of the hottest clubs in the US including L.A.’s Exchange &amp; Lure, San Francisco’s Ruby Skye &amp; Harlot, New York’s Pacha, XS in Las Vegas, and Miami’s LIV. With more big shows forthcoming, Audien is ready to continue his rapid rise out of Mystic, and around the world.</p>","TwitterName":"Audien","IsRemoved":false,"VideoUrl":"","WebsiteUrl":"http://www.audiendj.com/","ItunesAlbums":[],"ListViewImageUrl":"http://rscdn.festapp.com/c89e68c6-9f03-4de9-814a-9edb7695d49b3.jpg","SmallImageUrl":"http://rscdn.festapp.com/c89e68c6-9f03-4de9-814a-9edb7695d49b2.jpg","ProfilePlusImageUrl":null,"BigImageUrl":"http://rscdn.festapp.com/c89e68c6-9f03-4de9-814a-9edb7695d49b4.jpg","IsLineupArtist":true,"IsMultiArtist":false,"IsFeaturedArtist":false,"IsItunesable":true,"SoundCloud":"https://soundcloud.com/audien","SchedulingServiceArtistId":null,"FacebookUrl":"http://www.facebook.com/AudienMusic","YouTubeUrl":null,"InstagramUrl":"http://www.instagram.com/audien/","SpotifyTrackUri":null,"SpotifyUrl":null},{"ArtistId":1038003,"FeaturedSortOrder":0,"VenueArtistId":0,"ArtistName":"Borgeous","ArtistTitle":null,"Likes":0,"ArtistBio":"<p style=\"\">For the last two years, BORGEOUS has had an astronomical rise to fame.

Understanding and unravelling the complex and subjective human relationship with tones, textures and triads is a constant quest for musical clarity. For the most passionate artists, this quest will take a lifetime…</p><p>Passionate artists like Camo (Reini) and Krooked (Markus): Two young Austrians who met on the skateboard but made a lifelong pact in the studio almost 10 years ago. Quickly identifying a shared vision and thirst for sonic communication, the pair have been asking themselves the questions above (and many more) since their earliest releases in the late 2000s.</p><p>At first they found answers within the high energy, chaotic parameters of drum &amp; bass. But, as they’ve persisted on their quest, found more answers and asked more questions, they’re now exploring a much wider world of musical possibilities.</p><p>For artists so young, they’ve already achieved a huge deal: Few electronic acts are staring down the barrel of their fourth album at this stage of their career. Even fewer artists have created a made-to-measure live experience with as much attention to detail as their Zeitgeist show.</p><p>But everything you know about Camo &amp; Krooked so far barely scratches the surface compared to their next ambitious project. Here’s what they’re up to… And how they got there.</p><p>NEW HORIZONS<br>“It’s about exceeding what you’ve done before. The next step has to be better. If we made the same thing over and over it would be painful. It’s not creative. We love the idea of not knowing what may happen. Fuck the safe path – we want to explore new paths. Some people might not like it. But that’s the risk we enjoy taking… And we’re not going to know if it has paid off until people receive it.” – Reini</p><p>These paths have been teased throughout their career – particularly with the brushed metal electro sheen of 2011’s ‘Make The Call’ and 2010’s paranoid minimal tech alias Chrome – but were properly swathed down in September 2013 with the release of their third album ‘Zeitgeist’.</p><p>After two successful thoroughbred drum &amp; bass albums – ‘Above &amp; Beyond’ (Mainframe, 2010) and ‘Cross The Line’ (Hospital, 2011) – ‘Zeitgeist’ was a game-changing document that showed Reini and Markus’s true passions, musical scope and future vision.</p><p>Embracing drum &amp; bass’s famously high production standards while breaking down its infamously conservative formulas and tempo restrictions, ‘Zeitgeist’ compounded a stronger signature than they’d displayed previously…</p><p>Disco, techno, soul and funk were brazenly smelted down as the young duo carved delicate synthetic textures with soft plucks, spacious minimalist design and detailed arrangements. Abandoning scene expectation and fears of technical limitation, ‘Zeitgeist’ was a calling card for a genre-free future where artists transcend boundaries created by the fans, the labels and, ultimately, themselves.</p><p>“We want to create a sound that no one else has done before. Not just technically, but in terms of arrangement. The goal? For people know the Camo &amp; Krooked sound at any tempo. There’s a safe way to play it when you’re establishing yourself and that’s how we did it on the first two albums… To a certain degree. But with ‘Zeitgeist’ we just did our own thing. Since then that way of thinking has grown so much it’s an intrinsic part of our musical journey.” – Markus</p><p>Joining them on this journey is essential. Many producers already have; the electric emotion and cosmic textures of ‘Zeitgeist’ are already being referenced, deftly nodded to and blatantly copied across drum &amp; bass.<br>The referees have become the reference: Now, in the true spirit of exceeding past accomplishments, they’re about to take this sound, spirit and creative ideology to a new level.</p><p>JOURNEY THROUGH SOUND<br>In the aftermath of ‘Zeitgeist’ and its ambitious bespoke hi-tech live show, Markus and Reini have continued to study and analyse musical dynamics; how sounds ignite emotions and feelings from deep within, how space and silence are just as important as the musical elements. Above all: how music tells its own unique story.</p><p>“We listen to everything we love and constantly dissect the chord progressions and arrangements. That’s how we’ve learnt. We’ve made the connections between D&amp;B and soul and funk. A lot of our development comes from listening and understanding.” – Reini</p><p>Studying the new masters from Jon Hopkins to Tame Impala to David August, Markus and Reini have toiled hard to understand their shared vision of their musicality and, most importantly, how they want to translate it to us.</p><p>Rather than use the same old in-the-box language, they’ve amassed a collection of analogue hardware to help them chisel and hone these messages furthermore: A Moog Sub37, Prophet8, Roland Chorus Echo, JoMoX MBaseII, Studer 961 mixing desk, mics to record their own percussion and drum libraries… The list is building, slowly but surely. Each machine helping them articulate their unique sound and define their own creative boundaries.</p><p>“Limiting your sound and understanding your machines and their capabilities is essential. Having that abundance of creative opportunities is dangerous; endlessly flicking through folders and VSTs means you never actually make anything .You never find your own sound. So we’ve thought about everything that pleases us and intrigues us so we can establish and really define our own sound. Besides…<br>Hardware just sounds better!” – Markus</p><p>The first taste of these analogue experiments since ‘Zeitgeist’ emerged in June 2015 with ‘Gravitas’. A dreamy, arpeggiated composition, it was the bespoke result of a creative partnership with Red Bull’s skydiving team, created to soundtrack one of the most beautiful aerial stunts the team have ever displayed. Sitting at a pensive 115BPM, ‘Gravitas’ instantly smacked of Camo &amp; Krooked’s sound while rolling at a tempo they’d never explored before. Another example of Markus and Reini’s musicianship, it acts as the quintessential tease for their highly anticipated fourth album.</p><p>BACK TO THE FUTURE<br>Camo &amp; Krooked’s new album is their most ambitious project to date. Joining Markus, Reini and their stash of outboard kit are a score of local upcoming vocalists (because they love working with new artist and supporting Austrian talent), wild-skill session musicians (because they know their own technical limitations and when to call in a pro to replicate their own strums and sketches) and industry professionals such as award-winning pop architect Simon Britton whose discography is peppered with legends from Kool &amp; The Gang to Eminem, Usher to Jimmy Cliff.<br>Even by the duo’s widescreen standards, it’s a brave new musical world. Building new sonic skylines on the impressive structures of their past, tracks such as the sun-freckled reflectivity of ‘Like I Do’, the delicate keys of ‘Black &amp; White’, the slo-mo techno drones and dark bass tones of ‘If Else’ galvanise Markus and Reini’s capabilities well into the future in a way that’s not been done by their peers before. Many hugely respected artists who first came to fame in drum &amp; bass have gone on to succeed on bigger stages… But not in the way Camo &amp; Krooked intend to do it.</p><p>“We put so much effort and blood, sweat and tears into writing something that’s unique and fresh and not already done,” states Markus. “We don’t want to be the next big radio act”</p><p>“I wonder how long it will take till the bubble bursts? When radio moves on, everyone moves on… We want to make a deeper connection. We want people who stay with us and join the journey and not people who just respond to the hype and move-on as quickly after. But we can only do this if we are true to ourselves.”</p><p>With honesty and clarity as strong as their sonic signatures and musical passions, this is the sound of two men on a lifelong quest to understand and unravel the complex and subjective human relationship with music.</p><p>This is the sound of two men at a newfound creative peak.</p><p>This is next level Camo &amp; Krooked.</p><p>Do you have any questions?</p>","TwitterName":"CamoKrooked","IsRemoved":false,"VideoUrl":"","WebsiteUrl":"http://www.camoandkrooked.com/","ItunesAlbums":[],"ListViewImageUrl":"http://rscdn.festapp.com/f2c6f2a6-ebdb-49f8-871d-7d7458e03ee83.jpg","SmallImageUrl":"http://rscdn.festapp.com/f2c6f2a6-ebdb-49f8-871d-7d7458e03ee82.jpg","ProfilePlusImageUrl":null,"BigImageUrl":"http://rscdn.festapp.com/f2c6f2a6-ebdb-49f8-871d-7d7458e03ee84.jpg","IsLineupArtist":true,"IsMultiArtist":false,"IsFeaturedArtist":false,"IsItunesable":true,"SoundCloud":"https://soundcloud.com/camokrooked","SchedulingServiceArtistId":null,"FacebookUrl":"https://www.facebook.com/CamoKrooked/","YouTubeUrl":null,"InstagramUrl":"https://www.instagram.com/camokrooked/","SpotifyTrackUri":null,"SpotifyUrl":null},{"ArtistId":1038007,"FeaturedSortOrder":0,"VenueArtistId":0,"ArtistName":"Cheat Codes","ArtistTitle":null,"Likes":0,"ArtistBio":"","TwitterName":"cheatcodesmusic","IsRemoved":false,"VideoUrl":"","WebsiteUrl":"http://www.cheatcodesmusic.com/","ItunesAlbums":[],"ListViewImageUrl":"http://rscdn.festapp.com/b7a16145-e4b8-4593-8e09-83b17cd36c393.jpg","SmallImageUrl":"http://rscdn.festapp.com/b7a16145-e4b8-4593-8e09-83b17cd36c392.jpg","ProfilePlusImageUrl":null,"BigImageUrl":"http://rscdn.festapp.com/b7a16145-e4b8-4593-8e09-83b17cd36c394.jpg","IsLineupArtist":true,"IsMultiArtist":false,"IsFeaturedArtist":false,"IsItunesable":true,"SoundCloud":"https://soundcloud.com/cheatcodesmusic","SchedulingServiceArtistId":null,"FacebookUrl":"https://www.facebook.com/cheatcodesmusic/","YouTubeUrl":null,"InstagramUrl":"https://www.instagram.com/cheatcodesmusic/","SpotifyTrackUri":null,"SpotifyUrl":null},{"ArtistId":1038008,"FeaturedSortOrder":0,"VenueArtistId":0,"ArtistName":"Chris Lake","ArtistTitle":null,"Likes":0,"ArtistBio":"<p style=\"\">Chris Lake taps into a singular spirit evocative of dance music’s golden age by infusing funked-out grooves and natural instrumentation into decidedly modern house. It’s a sonic aesthetic that instantly incites movement and has established him as a trailblazer in the electronic dance music world. That perspective also set the stage for his forthcoming full-length debut available on Ultra Music in 2014.</p><p>At 14 years old, the multi-instrumentalist discovered progressive house music, and his life completely changed with the purchase of a synthesizer. His hobby became a profession shortly thereafter.&nbsp;Lake soon went from releasing much talked-about remixes to dropping dancefloor bangers. “Changes” broke the Top 10 on Billboard’s Hot Dance Airplay chart in 2006, while “Carry Me Away”&nbsp;(featuring Emma Hewitt) dominated the same chart a year later.

After his Army tenure came to a close, Craig held a residency at the popular Full Moon events in Queensland. With the desire to continue honing his music craft strong, he moved to Los Angeles, where he enrolled in the SAE Institute and earned a degree in audio engineering.</p><p>In recent years Craig has continued to shift the gaze of the industry in his direction. His deft ability to produce both gritty banging electro and underground techno has opened many doors for him, with releases and remixes for notable labels such as Dim Mak, Motorik, Relief, Perfect Driver, and many more. 2013 saw Craig release an EP with Bromance starlet Louisahhh!!!, as well as \"Paradise,\" a Beatport-charting collaboration with Chicago luminary Green Velvet which appeared on the legend's recent full length album Unshakeable.

However, it’s worth noting that there are, in fact, a few fucks the guys do give when it comes to their music. Which they have no problem showing.In the studio, Sedz and Fish channel their unabashed, fuck-all attitudes into tracks like their sultry debut single “Face Down”, and the lush vocal cut “Echo”. The guys coin an atmospheric and deep-leaning sound that’s suited to no one particular environment. As Fish tells it, “you should be able to enjoy it everywhere.” Mates since childhood, Cut Snake grew up on the Gold Coast of Australia; surfing professionally and competing against each other from the time they were 12. In this time, they developed the hilarious banter and incredible dynamic that is still prevalent in interviews and on stage. The guys got into dance music while they were touring the world for surf contests and quickly grew passionate about the underground scenes from each country they visited. With plenty of time waiting for waves, they fine-tuned their production skills from beachfront bungalows, giving their music a fresh feel and their live show a vibe like no other. Outside of their wildly successful surf careers, Sedz channeled his passion and focus for the sport into his music production, and for that he’s known as the “mad scientist” of the duo. Fish is known for his web series, Followthefish.tv. His wild personality and contagious laugh have made him one of the biggest personalities in the surfing industry to date. Now that Cut Snake has relocated stateside and inked a deal with Three Six Zero / Warner Bros. Records, the guys flout the seriousness of the scene in every way possible. Their crazy video antics have amassed a cult following in their home country of Australia and given the guys an edge on US turf. The edge, of course, is in teaching their American audience how to take a break from their day jobs and have a fucking beer...or seven.","TwitterName":"cutsnake","IsRemoved":false,"VideoUrl":"","WebsiteUrl":"http://www.cutsnake.com/","ItunesAlbums":[],"ListViewImageUrl":"http://rscdn.festapp.com/ad47f940-2df2-41fb-b8aa-15ae16b086903.jpg","SmallImageUrl":"http://rscdn.festapp.com/ad47f940-2df2-41fb-b8aa-15ae16b086902.jpg","ProfilePlusImageUrl":null,"BigImageUrl":"http://rscdn.festapp.com/ad47f940-2df2-41fb-b8aa-15ae16b086904.jpg","IsLineupArtist":true,"IsMultiArtist":false,"IsFeaturedArtist":false,"IsItunesable":true,"SoundCloud":"https://soundcloud.com/cutsnake","SchedulingServiceArtistId":null,"FacebookUrl":"https://www.facebook.com/cutsnakemusic","YouTubeUrl":null,"InstagramUrl":"https://www.instagram.com/cutsnake/","SpotifyTrackUri":null,"SpotifyUrl":null},{"ArtistId":1038012,"FeaturedSortOrder":0,"VenueArtistId":0,"ArtistName":"Darren Porter","ArtistTitle":null,"Likes":0,"ArtistBio":"<p style=\"\">From the humble surroundings of the north east of England, near Newcastle, Darren Porter began his musical journey experimenting with keyboards and pianos and without the ability to read music and not one music lesson he was able to learn what made music work, from this he began to write small film scores for independent short films, but his real passion lay with electronic music.</p><p>Whilst not ready to let the world hear his music Darren held back until he was happy with what he could hear, he then entered the “Dave Pearce bedroom producer” competition which he won after Dave heard his track “termination” only hours before the show went live, “Termination” was subsequently signed to Oceanstate Recordings.</p><p>Over the last few years Darren has built a steady reputation for driving and hard euphoric uplifting remixes known to deliver huge energy, all his remixes have been supported by some of the biggest DJ’s on the planet. 2011 was a monumental year for Darren Porter – winning the title “Tough as Titanium track of the Week” for his monster chart topping release “Daytona” – Signing his collaboration track “Springs Scent” to Sean Tyas’ label Titanium Recordings which was tracklisted at ASOT500. 2012 saw Darren explode with a flurry of remixes and originals and caught the attention of big game players even earning himself a worldwide twitter trend for his track “Foundry” while been played and supported by Armin Van Buuren.

Oh, and he’s one half of the acclaimed duo New World Punx (with Ferry Corsten) who were just announced as performers at Coachella 2015.</p><p>As we step into 2015 Markus Schulz is up for yet another challenge. For the past eight years Markus has created a mix compilation and dedicated it to a city that inspired him that year. The last one he released was Buenos Aires 13. Rather than do another compilation based on one city, in 2015, Markus is introducing his “City Series.” Each month he’ll release a track and dedicate it to a city that he’ll be playing at that month. He will record elements of the live show and utilize sounds of the venue to complete the compilation titled Markus Schulz‐ World Tour 2015.</p><p>The first release in the “City Series” is entitled “Bayfront (Miami).” Home of the legendary Club Space, the epic Ultra Music Festival and the ever‐moving Groove Cruise, Markus' contributions to all three institutions is vast. “Bayfront (Miami)” drives in the monster truck lane of trance; focused on the tougher side of the genre. it’s easy to see this one going off right before Markus takes you down the rabbit hole during one of his extended sets. That’s Markus’ Miami.</p><p>“When examining the cities which have impacted my body of work throughout the years, you have to consider your day‐to‐day surroundings and the reason why you call a particular place home. Had it not been for my days as a weekly resident at Club Space, I would never have had the privilege of displaying my talents on an international basis. When I learned that I would be welcoming 2015 at Space with a signature open to close solo set, it was only appropriate to commence this project by paying tribute to my home turf. Bayfront is not just a track dedicated to the club, but will play a pivotal role in my appearances at the Groove Cruise in January, and the Ultra Music Festival in March.

He first made his name with Hospital Records in 2009 with a series of blistering releases including single ‘Memory Lane’ and his infamous self-titled debut album ‘Netsky’ propelling the talented young producer from Antwerp into the premiere league. Starting out with an underground drum ‘n’ bass label like Chase &amp; Status did before him, Hospital Records ended up being the perfect springboard for Boris Daenen to get to where he is today.</p><p>Hailing from Antwerp Belgium, in a few short years, Netsky has built a reputation for consistently delivering hard-hitting drum &amp; bass anthems. As comfortable onstage at festivals and club shows as he is behind the studio mixing desk, (Netsky’s live show, unveiled in 2012 at London’s Brixton Academy, was also something of a game-changer), he effortlessly blurs the lines between artist and superstar DJ/producer, with a slew of A-list artist remixes under his belt, including Swedish House Mafia ‘One’, Rusko’s ‘Everyday’, and more recently he lent his magical touch to remixes for Madeon, Ed Sheeran and Jack U. Fans, of course, have heard these tracks at some of the world’s biggest festivals: from Ultra Music Festival in Miami and Coachella to Future Music Festival in Australia and Wireless in London, not to mention more rock-focused festivals like Reading &amp; Leeds and Pukkelpop. And at every show, the reaction is the same: complete carnage. Netksy is a bona fide superstar and the reaction to his shows has been akin to legendary rock concerts of days gone by. So far, so good.</p><p>Having signed to Epic Records for his first major release, ‘Rio’ is the first taste of the forthcoming new album from Netsky in 2015. We assume you’ve been to Rio at some point? ““I went to Sao Paolo a couple of months ago but I’ve never visited actually!” he laughs. “What happened was I was working with Digital Farm Animals and the whole track had a sunny samba vibe and the vocals were about having relationships but not settling. Not thinking about tomorrow, thinking about today. It’s about traveling and having fun and staying young.”<br><br>Of course, Netsky himself is doing a lot of these things already. In person, he is super-chilled, calm and collected, with his forthcoming and third artist album now in the finishing touches stage. So is the rest of the album like ‘Rio’ in spirit? “Production-wise, it’s much more about songs and much less about production - every song regardless of whether it was a ‘pop’ song or drum ‘n’ bass, we would write on piano. ‘Thunder’ is a track with Emili Sandé which we just performed at Wireless together - she wrote the song and I produced it but it was quite organic in the end as we wrote the verses in the studio together.” Sandé is a big deal in the Netsky household, “For me, it’s a big deal,” he nods. “Emeli is the first big UK singer that I’ve worked with and she just happens to be my number 1 new singer of the past 5 years! I introduced her to the band and she was amazing.”</p><p>As well as Beth Ditto and Emeli, the album also features one track called ‘TNT’ (“it’s called ‘TNT’ because it’s a very explosive funk pop song!”) with US funk-soul brothers Chromeo which has an 80s Prince vibe and sees Netsky “going back to my roots before I knew electronic music.” He reckons the album will ultimately be ten songs and also “…quite diverse. It’s a much more live sounding album. There are lots of strings and live guitars and it’s an organic album, not one made with 10 producers and engineers. A lot of it is just me in my studio at home.” With additional strings by the Brussells Philharmonic, for the record.</p><p>He’s especially aware that some artist albums are weighed down with too many guest collaborations.&nbsp; “I didn’t want to go that way at all but I enjoyed working with Digital Farm Animals and we wrote a lot from scratch. There will be a few songs on the album together. It felt alright doing it that way rather than getting massive vocalists at the start. I would love to sing myself but I cant sing and that’s not what people want to hear!”</p><p>The final piece of the puzzle is performing the new music live. “Saturday at Wireless was fantastic. We’ve already been touring for two-and-a-half years. We just did a 40 date tour in the US which was incredible and now is the beginning of Version 2.0. I’m thinking of having cartoon imagery onstage - the ‘Rio’ video is made up of some very cool animation so I’m trying to incorporate more visuals as well as more instruments onstage! ‘Rio’ is starting to do well in America so I may get a second base in LA soon. America has been inspirational, one of the best tours I’ve done in my life. “And finally, are there any other surprises you can tell us about? “I want to focus on all the different cities in Europe as well as the UK and Belgium. We’re thinking about doing a show for each city in Europe. With the new single ‘Rio’ showing a more unusual side to Netsky’s musical palette, it’s clear that he’s only just getting started. For the record, the name Netsky is based on a particularly icky computer virus: clearly, resistance to this Belgian superstar DJ/producer is futile.</p>","TwitterName":"netskymusic","IsRemoved":false,"VideoUrl":"","WebsiteUrl":"https://www.netskymusic.com/","ItunesAlbums":[],"ListViewImageUrl":"http://rscdn.festapp.com/40962503-4697-41df-8781-ab3b9b4d7fd93.jpg","SmallImageUrl":"http://rscdn.festapp.com/40962503-4697-41df-8781-ab3b9b4d7fd92.jpg","ProfilePlusImageUrl":null,"BigImageUrl":"http://rscdn.festapp.com/40962503-4697-41df-8781-ab3b9b4d7fd94.jpg","IsLineupArtist":true,"IsMultiArtist":false,"IsFeaturedArtist":false,"IsItunesable":true,"SoundCloud":"https://soundcloud.com/netsky","SchedulingServiceArtistId":null,"FacebookUrl":"https://www.facebook.com/netskymusic/","YouTubeUrl":null,"InstagramUrl":"https://www.instagram.com/netskyofficial/","SpotifyTrackUri":null,"SpotifyUrl":null},{"ArtistId":1038046,"FeaturedSortOrder":0,"VenueArtistId":0,"ArtistName":"Paul van Dyk","ArtistTitle":null,"Likes":0,"ArtistBio":"Over the last 20 years, the term ‘electronic dance music’ and the name ‘Paul van Dyk’ have become all but synonymous.

Selling out shows in every dance music-centric city on the planet, it’s seen him break more than his share of world records, earn himself legions of fans and win numerous accolades in the process.&nbsp;<br><br>Paul is famous for circling the globe 16 times every year and entertaining in excess of 3 million music lovers as he goes. Playing upwards of 150 shows annually, he spends a full 2 months of every 12 in the air travelling to and from events. Among those have been his Barra Beach, Rio show, where on New Year’s Eve 2008 he spun to an unprecedented, then record-setting 1.5 million-strong audience. He has twice been voted the world’s No.1 DJ - a feat achieved to-date by just three other spinners. In 2014, he was aggregated as the #1 DJ Mag DJ of all time. As a producer PvD (as he’s known to fans) has achieved similar success. In 1994 he released ‘For An Angel’, a track that 20 years after it was recorded was hailed as the 8th greatest dance track of all time by Mixmag. Van Dyk has, and continues to be a regular film &amp; game score contributor, which has resulted in numerous notable OST credits. They have included his rework of Hollywood composer Hans Zimmer’s ‘A Poor Choice of Words’ for The Dark Knight soundtrack and ‘Still Alive’ for EA’s groundbreaking Mirror’s Edge game. He’s also owner of one electronic music’s most outstanding remixographies, with his hallmark remix sound being applied to acts like U2, Depeche Mode &amp; New Order, as well as acts as diverse as Madonna and industrial metal rockers Rammstein. His most recent album (Paul’s 7th) ‘The Politics Of Dancing 3’ met with major press acclaim in 2015, spawning a run of Beatport #1 singles.&nbsp;<br><br>Throughout his career PvD’s picked up many coveted nominations and awards.

I started really young, growing up as a teenager in and around Bristol in the 90’s. Creating music, art and friendships has been central to everything – for me it’s always been about street culture, independence and productivity.”</p><p>Autumn 2015 marks the release of ‘X Colour’, the new debut full-length album from Redlight (aka Hugh Pescod), and the start of another new chapter for an artist who’s been immersed in music and creativity for as long as he can recall. “I’ve released a lot of club music in my life,” Redlight continues, “so much of it that I’m very proud of, but this has been a completely new creative experience for me, and as Redlight, this is my first album; it’s not gonna be my last. I wanted to set a strong foundation.” This release is the start of something, a whole new level than before, but in fact the foundation has been building over decades of commitment, packed with career and life-defining moments.</p><p>“X Colour is the culmination of two years of development and focus, and it’s taken me to new places – different cities, studios, collaborations, inspirations; the whole lot. Part of that was going and spending time in America, and in particular New York; I recorded most of the vocals for the album there and worked with new people. That definitely had a big influence on the song structures and sounds I focussed on.”</p><p>The last major chapter turn was back in 2008. Taking a year out and leaving the drum’n bass scene he’d worked so hard to contribute to with Full Cycle et al; Hugh put a stop on all bookings and releases, then locked himself away in the studio to try and reposition his creative energy – and in many ways recapture the passion for that creative energy. Hugh explains, “I found myself going out and playing raves and not enjoying it like I once had – but it wasn’t the fault of the music or the scene, it was my own fault. I was frustrated for even feeling that way, and I realised I needed to find a new direction at that point.”</p><p>That fallow year proved to be a huge turning point, as the artist formerly known as Clipz came again with Redlight, and the launch of a new self-owned label ‘Lobster Boy’. Refocusing and embracing a love for House, Techno, Hip Hop and vocal-lead dance music whilst channelling all the knowledge and inspiration from Jungle, DnB and bass music, this was a whole new genre-free ‘cross-cultured dance music’.</p><p>“I really wanted to work with some great vocalists, and create music that could transcend a nightclub vibe. That was a big driving factor for me, and as soon as I dropped the tempo and experimented with new rhythms, it all just started to make sense and I felt free to try something new, and it felt good. It opened up everything for me.”</p><p>Like many big decisions or changes in life, a newfound drive and direction also proved to lead towards new experiences and friendships. While Releasing early hits for Shy FX’s Digital Soundboy Recordings and Chase and Status’s MTA label, a new generation of UK producers and DJs started to emerge, “When I came with the first Redlight ‘Lobster Boy’ EP, I started to meet some key new people in my life that definitely inspired me. People like Toddla, Skream, Joker – and the guys behind Motion in Bristol where we were all playing at the time. All of us came from different parts of the UK and no one was conforming, we were making our own styles of music that worked for a whole spectrum of others. It was all about independence and doing it for yourself – but everyone shared their music, ideas and released on each other’s labels. It wasn’t just a new name and a new music tempo for me, that time made me realise a whole new way of operating, being creative and working with people.”</p><p>Fast-forward to now and Redlight can confidently be placed amongst the UK’s most consistent and exciting producers of recent years. There’s been a slew of stand out releases via his own Lobster Boy label, a UK Top 10 hit in ‘Lost In Your Love’ via Polydor Records, remixes for the likes of Cee Lo Green, Tink and Ms Dynamite, and even a recent single with legendary Wu-Tang Clan founding member Raekwon on the ’36 EP’. “I was 14 in 1994 when Wu-Tang’s ‘36 Chambers’ dropped, I was just starting to tune into DJing and going to free parties and illegal raves, and the US Hip Hop at the time was such a major influence on all of us. To now be working with artists I looked up to like Raekwon and Mobb Deep in the studio, as well as some amazing fresh talent like Billie Black and Melisa Whiskey, it’s a dream come true really.”</p><p>There’s been numerous world tours as a DJ, with an on going 52 week international schedule of shows to perform, Redlight tells us, “There’s very few things that match the buzz of DJing for me, I’ve always loved it.” That combined with a growing roster of label talent on Lobster Boy such as Mele, Mella D, New York Transit Authority and Mak &amp; Pasteman that’s been carefully nurtured and pushed, you have an artist riding the pinnacle of the journey so far.</p><p>With the imminent release of X Colour, Redlight is confident the ‘journey’ has a long way to go yet, and in many ways, this is just the start. A self-proclaimed film obsessive, X Colour was produced with an underlying script concept, telling the story of a turbulent relationship between a girl and a guy. Redlight explains, “I had this vision of a couple who were going off the rails, with every tune following their story. ‘Gold Teeth’ is the nightclub scene where they’re just going for it, getting fucked up, partying and escaping normality. Then there’s ‘Repetition’ which is the inevitable comedown, ‘Where’s The Love’ is where it’s all gone wrong and ‘Ride or Die’ finishes the story – it’s where they’re meant to come back together but one of them has disappeared… So the record’s called ‘X Colour’ – ten colours, ten scenes and ten different emotions.”</p><p>His most progressive and accomplished work to date, the new single ‘Threshold’ feat.

In tune, Ruben’s track ‘Stoer’ walked into the hands of Joris Voorn’s Rejected Records where it saw the tech driven artist embrace its entrance. The highlight of 2015 was, without a doubt, creating the official anthem song for the world largest outdoor trance festival, Amsterdam’s ‘Electronic Family Festival’.</p><p>Stepping outside the studio and Ruben De Ronde unleashes in the clubs and upon the stage, dominating bill spots across Ultra Music Festival (Miami), Dance valley, Nature One’s main stage, Kazantip, A State of Trance live events and gracing half a million people welcoming in Hanoi’s new year.

The roots of his sound stem from both his home town of Bristol, and his seasonal home in Ibiza, which have forged Will’s style; a style that fuses the best of Bristol’s bass elements with the upfront house music sensibilities of the white isle.</p><p>Having started on his path of 4/4 discovery at a young age Will’s early career defining moment was gaining a residency at Kanya in Ibiza, where he was able to hone his skills day and night in front of the Ibiza crowd, and his DJ peers, gaining fanbase and respect along the way. Will explains “Playing in Ibiza felt natural straight away. I get on and work well there, it fits, it’s my second home.”</p><p>Cutting into the DJ circuit is no mean feat, but the cream rises to the top, so whilst Will is busy DJing at an ever growing list of clubs he’s also getting prestigious gigs at clubs like Space and MOS. Along side these gigs Will has also be building his own club brand Cut a Rug. Holding regular parties at Motion in Bristol Cut A Rug have hosted the likes of Visionquest, Carl Cox, Boys Noize, Zombie Disco Squad and Hauswerks, with whom Will has been able to support on the decks, a job which is natural to him. Outside of the UK Will has been booked for his debut Australian tour towards the end of the summer. Along with trips back and fourth to NYC and not forgetting Ibiza during this summer.</p><p>Yet whilst DJing and promotion have been building well for Will, his real strengths lie in the studio. Having been committed to his studio for many years he also undertook a music production course that have seen him made rapid progress in a short time with releases on labels such as Anabatic, Exploited, Southern Fried, No Brainer along with the launch of his new label Cut A Rug. Some of Will’s recent releases has had support from the likes of Jamie Jones, Mista Jam, Hannah Wants with plays on Radio 1 and Radio 1 Xtra.&nbsp;</p><p>Talking of his approach to productions Will says “I make music for clobbers, not DJs. I sample a lot of old school rave tracks from the 90s, with 21st Century production techniques.” Then add those little influences from Bristol and Ibiza and you will understand why Will’s music holds such a broad appeal and is often supported by fellow DJ’s such as Justin Martin, Seth Troxler, Ardlander, J.Philip, Worthy, T.Williams, Waifs &amp; Strays, Pezzner and Miguel Migs.&nbsp;</p><p>Will Clarke is a talented, skilled, young producer who is making strides in the dance music business with his own sound and now his own label / events.
